# Calculating Potential Customer Returns with Rule-Based Classification
## Business Problem
A gaming company wants to create level-based new customer profiles (personas) using certain characteristics of its customers and then create segments based on these new customer profiles. They aim to estimate how much, on average, new potential customers, who match these segments, could potentially bring in revenue for the company.

The dataset "Persona.csv" contains the prices of products sold by an international gaming company and some demographic information of the users who purchased these products. The dataset is composed of records generated for each sales transaction. This means that the table has not been deduplicated. In other words, a user with specific demographic characteristics may have made multiple purchases.
